# kellens-dungeon
Repo for work on kellen's game

# How to use this github:

- Don't commit directly to stable unless you're hotfixing, MAKE SURE you pulled from stable
- Pull and push to dev branch at will, please make sure the game runs semi-stably before pushing
- Notify other devs if you're using the dev branch, feel free to make your own branch and merge as necessary
- Try not to erase anyone's work
- If making weapons or characters and not directly coding, use the branch provided to you by kellen, and request he help merge if you don't know what you're doing
